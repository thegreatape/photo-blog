One piece from a set I shot for my fianc&#233;e's [Etsy page](http://www.etsy.com/shop/inksplotter). To get that white-background-to-infinity effect, I wound up building a DIY lightbox on the cheap after reading [this article on Strobist](http://strobist.blogspot.com/2006/07/how-to-diy-10-macro-photo-studio.html).  Pretty much just a cardboard box with sides cut out and covered with tissue paper, a sheet of posterboard, and a bunch of movable light sources.  Good times!
