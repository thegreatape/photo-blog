The start of this lil' photoblog was in great part due to attempting a one-photo-a-day project.  I sputtered out after about month that time, but now it's back and augmented with *social media* (I feel dirty already).  Some friends and I have formed [Photopocalypse](http://www.flickr.com/groups/1340574@N25/), a Flickr group dedicated to keeping each other going on this one exposure a day thing.  

You should totally join us. Yes, you! I'm a completely awful photographer, so you've got nothing to be worried about.  It's a damn good way to get out there and practice.  Hopefully, we'll learn something along the way!
