<p>The best hacking is always done with a hacksaw! Microsoft&#8217;s ergo keyboards are really great, but they extend so far out to the right that my mouse arm sits at an uncomfortable angle. The solution? Remove the guts of the keyboard, re-assemble, saw off everything to the right of the enter key, put everything back in, and fold the dangling circuitry behind the board and tape it there! Keyboard Maestro handles remapping all the keys I lost that I actually use to various combinations of Alt-&#60;Something&#62;.</p>

<p>After I modified my first keyboard this way, the persistent pain in my right shoulder went away within a week. This is my third such hack-job, after the one I use at home came out the worse from an encounter with a glass of water.</p>
