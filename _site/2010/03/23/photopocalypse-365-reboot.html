<p>The start of this lil&#8217; photoblog was in great part due to attempting a one-photo-a-day project. I sputtered out after about month that time, but now it&#8217;s back and augmented with <em>social media</em> (I feel dirty already). Some friends and I have formed <a href='http://www.flickr.com/groups/1340574@N25/'>Photopocalypse</a>, a Flickr group dedicated to keeping each other going on this one exposure a day thing.</p>

<p>You should totally join us. Yes, you! I&#8217;m a completely awful photographer, so you&#8217;ve got nothing to be worried about. It&#8217;s a damn good way to get out there and practice. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll learn something along the way!</p>
