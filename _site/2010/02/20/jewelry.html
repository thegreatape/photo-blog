<p>One piece from a set I shot for my fianc&#233;e&#8217;s <a href='http://www.etsy.com/shop/inksplotter'>Etsy page</a>. To get that white-background-to-infinity effect, I wound up building a DIY lightbox on the cheap after reading <a href='http://strobist.blogspot.com/2006/07/how-to-diy-10-macro-photo-studio.html'>this article on Strobist</a>. Pretty much just a cardboard box with sides cut out and covered with tissue paper, a sheet of posterboard, and a bunch of movable light sources. Good times!</p>
